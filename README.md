Solidity Concepts â€“ Mappings, Events, and Data Locations
Opening Development Environment
I opened my SimpleStorage.sol contract file from your previous project in Remix IDE as the base for my AdvancedStorage project.
 Implement Mappings
I added a mapping "nameToFavoriteNumberMapping". I created a function called setNameToFavoriteNumber to store people names and their associated favorite numbers and I made it public. I used variable(string) "name" to take the 
person's name and favoriteNumber(uint256) to store the person's favoriteNumber.
